Perfect Bite is the perfect application for people who are unhappy with existing food tracking applications and want a better way to quickly and efficiently enter the food they ate, view their progress over time, and receive customized recommendations to achieve their personal goals. The application pairs with the Motorola 360 smartwatch to provide a very convenient way of entering foods and receiving personalized recommendations. Perfect Bite makes it easy to live a healthy on-the-go lifestyle by anticipating your eating habits, monitoring and reacting to nutritional intake, and guiding your dietary choices.

This repository contains both an Android mobile and wear application. The smartwatch interface allows users to input food and receive customized notifications on the go using voice. Using your eating history, the application recommends specific foods to help you reach your goals. The dynamic graphs allow users to customize target goals and view metrics over time.

## Summary & Novelty

Overall, Perfect Bite delivers a unique perspective for the existing food tracking market by providing a unique input method, a constantly improving database of foods, and customized recommendations based on personal goals and metrics. Although our application still maintains similar functionalities that exist in current food tracking applications, Perfect Bite removes several pain points that exist in current applications which render them frustrating and incredibly unreliable. These pain points include frustrating traditional search bars, an overwhelming amount of unnecessary information, and not being able to decipher personal metrics over time.

By developing the application around the Motorola 360 smartwatch and constructing simple workflows, we have made it easier to provide a proactive experience to our users. The application will discreetly send important and context aware recommendations to help users achieve their goals. Perfect Bite makes it easier to live a healthy on-the-go lifestyle by anticipating your eating habits, monitoring and reacting to nutritional intake, and guiding your dietary choices.
